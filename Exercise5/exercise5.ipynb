This dataset is divided into three parts:\n\n- A **training** set that your model will learn on: `X`, `y`\n- A **cross validation** set for determining the regularization parameter: `Xval`, `yval`\n- A **test** set for evaluating performance. These are “unseen” examples which your model did not see during training: `Xtest`, `ytest`\n\nRun the next cell to plot the training data. In the following parts, you will implement linear regression and use that to fit a straight line to the data and plot learning curves.

Models with high bias are not complex enough for the data and tend to underfit, while models with high variance overfit to the training data.\n\nIn this part of the exercise, you will plot training and test errors on a learning curve to diagnose bias-variance problems.\n\n### 2.1 Learning Curves\n\nYou will now implement code to generate the learning curves that will be useful in debugging learning algorithms. Recall that a learning curve plots training and cross validation error as a function of training set size. Your job is to fill in the function `learningCurve` in the next cell, so that it returns a vector of errors for the training set and cross validation set.\n\nTo plot the learning curve, we need a training and cross validation set error for different training set sizes. To obtain different training set sizes, you should use different subsets of the original training set `X`. Specifically, for a training set size of $i$, you should use the first $i$ examples (i.e., `X[:i, :]`\nand `y[:i]`).\n\nYou can use the `trainLinearReg` function (by calling `utils.trainLinearReg(...)`) to find the $\\theta$ parameters. Note that the `lambda_` is passed as a parameter to the `learningCurve` function.\nAfter learning the $\\theta$ parameters, you should compute the error on the training and cross validation sets. Recall that the training error for a dataset is defined as\n\n$$ J_{\\text{train}} = \\frac{1}{2m} \\left[ \\sum_{i=1}^m \\left(h_\\theta \\left( x^{(i)} \\right) - y^{(i)} \\right)^2 \\right] $$\n\nIn particular, note that the training error does not include the regularization term. One way to compute the training error is to use your existing cost function and set $\\lambda$ to 0 only when using it to compute the training error and cross validation error. When you are computing the training set error, make sure you compute it on the training subset (i.e., `X[:n,:]` and `y[:n]`) instead of the entire training set. However, for the cross validation error, you should compute it over the entire cross validation set. You should store\nthe computed errors in the vectors error train and error val.\n\n<a id=\"func2\"></a>","metadata":{"cell_id":"00017-4209ef1c-8690-457f-91fc-854a193ed951"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"cell_id":"00018-590bd3af-e06e-4ca1-aff1-33f264a78542"},"source":"def learningCurve(X, y, Xval, yval, lambda_=0):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates the train and cross validation set errors needed to plot a learning curve\n    returns the train and cross validation set errors for a learning curve. \n    \n    In this function, you will compute the train and test errors for\n    dataset sizes from 1 up to m.

The polynomial terms have simply turned into features that we can use for linear regression. We are using the same cost function and gradient that you wrote for the earlier part of this exercise.\n\nFor this part of the exercise, you will be using a polynomial of degree 8. It turns out that if we run the training directly on the projected data, will not work well as the features would be badly scaled (e.g., an example with $x = 40$ will now have a feature $x_8 = 40^8 = 6.5 \\times 10^{12}$). Therefore, you will\nneed to use feature normalization.\n\nBefore learning the parameters $\\theta$ for the polynomial regression, we first call `featureNormalize` and normalize the features of the training set, storing the mu, sigma parameters separately. We have already implemented this function for you (in `utils.py` module) and it is the same function from the first exercise.\n\nAfter learning the parameters $\\theta$, you should see two plots generated for polynomial regression with $\\lambda = 0$, which should be similar to the ones here:\n\n<table>\n    <tr>\n        <td><img src=\"Figures/polynomial_regression.png\"></td>\n        <td><img src=\"Figures/polynomial_learning_curve.png\"></td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n\nYou should see that the polynomial fit is able to follow the datapoints very well, thus, obtaining a low training error. The figure on the right shows that the training error essentially stays zero for all numbers of training samples. However, the polynomial fit is very complex and even drops off at the extremes. This is an indicator that the polynomial regression model is overfitting the training data and will not generalize well.\n\nTo better understand the problems with the unregularized ($\\lambda = 0$) model, you can see that the learning curve  shows the same effect where the training error is low, but the cross validation error is high. There is a gap between the training and cross validation errors, indicating a high variance problem.","metadata":{"cell_id":"00029-09d0a7ce-ebb0-4b11-8ff3-cd3ef52715f2"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"cell_id":"00030-3c5cf716-d5a1-4379-a3eb-38cc039ca9ec"},"source":"lambda_ = 0\ntheta = utils.trainLinearReg(linearRegCostFunction, X_poly, y,\n                             lambda_=lambda_, maxiter=55)\n\n# Plot training data and fit\npyplot.plot(X, y, 'ro', ms=10, mew=1.5, mec='k')\n\nutils.plotFit(polyFeatures, np.min(X), np.max(X), mu, sigma, theta, p)\n\npyplot.xlabel('Change in water level (x)')\npyplot.ylabel('Water flowing out of the dam (y)')\npyplot.title('Polynomial Regression Fit (lambda = %f)' % lambda_)\npyplot.ylim([-20, 50])\n\npyplot.figure()\nerror_train, error_val = learningCurve(X_poly, y, X_poly_val, yval, lambda_)\npyplot.plot(np.arange(1, 1+m), error_train, np.arange(1, 1+m), error_val)\n\npyplot.title('Polynomial Regression Learning Curve (lambda = %f)' % lambda_)\npyplot.xlabel('Number of training examples')\npyplot.ylabel('Error')\npyplot.axis([0, 13, 0, 100])\npyplot.legend(['Train', 'Cross Validation'])\n\nprint('Polynomial Regression (lambda = %f)\\n' % lambda_)\nprint('# Training Examples\\tTrain Error\\tCross Validation Error')\nfor i in range(m):\n    print('  \\t%d\\t\\t%f\\t%f' % (i+1, error_train[i], error_val[i]))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"One way to combat the overfitting (high-variance) problem is to add regularization to the model.

You should now modify the the lambda parameter and try $\\lambda = 1, 100$. For each of these values, the script should generate a polynomial fit to the data and also a learning curve.\n\nFor $\\lambda = 1$, the generated plots should look like the the figure below. You should see a polynomial fit that follows the data trend well (left) and a learning curve (right) showing that both the cross validation and training error converge to a relatively low value. This shows the $\\lambda = 1$ regularized polynomial regression model does not have the high-bias or high-variance problems. In effect, it achieves a good trade-off between bias and variance.\n\n<table>\n    <tr>\n        <td><img src=\"Figures/polynomial_regression_reg_1.png\"></td>\n        <td><img src=\"Figures/polynomial_learning_curve_reg_1.png\"></td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n\nFor $\\lambda = 100$, you should see a polynomial fit (figure below) that does not follow the data well.

In particular, a model without regularization ($\\lambda = 0$) fits the training set well, but does not generalize. Conversely, a model with too much regularization ($\\lambda = 100$) does not fit the training set and testing set well. A good choice of $\\lambda$ (e.g., $\\lambda = 1$) can provide a good fit to the data.\n\nIn this section, you will implement an automated method to select the $\\lambda$ parameter. Concretely, you will use a cross validation set to evaluate how good each $\\lambda$ value is. After selecting the best $\\lambda$ value using the cross validation set, we can then evaluate the model on the test set to estimate\nhow well the model will perform on actual unseen data. \n\nYour task is to complete the code in the function `validationCurve`. Specifically, you should should use the `utils.trainLinearReg` function to train the model using different values of $\\lambda$ and compute the training error and cross validation error. You should try $\\lambda$ in the following range: {0, 0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10}.\n<a id=\"validationCurve\"></a>","metadata":{"cell_id":"00032-02a7fcc2-3946-41e3-a047-4abd2865d493"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"cell_id":"00033-3f34706e-4909-4d48-b510-4fb751b50600"},"source":"def validationCurve(X, y, Xval, yval):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate the train and validation errors needed to plot a validation\n    curve that we can use to select lambda_.\n    \n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    X : array_like\n        The training dataset.
